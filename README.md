# PyTg

PyTg is a set of scripts for performing Bayesian inference fits on ellipsometric measurements of the glass transition temperature. In order to run the scripts, a working installation of Python with PyMC and its dependencies is required. To accomplish this on on Windows, a virtual installation environment is preferred (see https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/installation.html). Running "env_setup.py" will do this automatically.
