# PyTg

PyTg is a set of scripts for performing Bayesian inference fits on ellipsometric measurements of the glass transition temperature. In order to run the scripts, a working installation of Python with PyMC and its dependencies is required. We recommend first installing Anaconda python (available at https://www.anaconda.com/download) to streamline this process. A virtual python installation environment is preferred (see https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/installation.html) to preserve the state of any existing base python environment on your machine. Running "env_setup.py" will do this automatically when run from the Anaconda prompt.
